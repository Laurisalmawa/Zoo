# Zoo

Zoo is an app that will give you information about the animal species that we have in there. It will ask you for your favorite specie and once you write it, you will be able to see the name of the animal and the trainer will command the 
animal to move.

## Resources used

For this proyect they were used the four fundamental pillars of the object-oriented programming. Such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polimorfism. The encapsulation could be seen in the access to the information of the
properties only by the methods in each class, the inheritance could be seen in the classes that got the methods a properties from the principal class Animal, and as well it could be seen that by using the method from the root class and
adding some information the poliformism is used. And last but not least by calling all the classes in one only we use the abstaction to abstract all the classes in there.
